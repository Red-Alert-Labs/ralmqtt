## About
**RALMQTT** is designed for pentesters and aims to make MQTT Broker pentesting easier. Several modes are available:

- **Discovery**: Gathers information about the broker (authentication, version, clients, uptime, etc.).
- **Bruteforce**: Allows user-password bruteforce (default wordlist is based on mirai).
- **DoS**: Implements the method described in [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/10/2932) by Ivan Vaccari, Maurizio Aiello, and Enrico Cambiaso.

### Attack Scenario
An attack scenario using these 3 modes could be like the following:

1. **Discovery**: Gather info on the broker, requiring user password authentication.
2. **Bruteforce**: Try to bruteforce login credentials. If successful, launch Discovery mode again with the credentials.
3. **DoS**: If bruteforce fails, sniff valid connect packets. One way is through a mitm attack (like ARP poisoning) between a client and the broker. Launch a DoS attack on the broker until keepalive messages fail forcing to stop every client-broker TCP connections. Once the attack is stopped, the client establishes a new connection and voil√† ! Since a mitm is in place, we freely sniff valid credentials and clientId. 

## Installation

Installing ralmqtt is pretty straight forward : 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/polo-le-rigolo/ralmqtt

# Create a venv to use the tool
python3 -m venv VENVMQTT
source VENVMQTT/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once you are done using the tool just deactivate the venv with the command **deactivate**

Bringing Trust to the Internet of Things
RALMQTT is a python based tool designed for MQTT pentesting

Usage: `python3 ralmqtt.py -m <attack mode> -a <addr> [-P <port>] [-p <password>] [-u <user>]`

Options:
- `-m, --mode`       Mode (choose from : discovery/dos/bruteforce)
- `-a, --addr`       Broker's address
- `-P, --port`       Broker's port (default value being 1883)
- `-p, --password`   Broker's password (optional)
- `-u, --user`       Broker's username (optional)
- `-w, --wordlist`   Password wordlist for bruteforce mode (default ./passwords.txt)

**Examples :**

- `python3 ralmqtt.py -a test.mosquitto.org -m discovery` 

This command runs ralmqtt in **discovery mode** to find information about the MQTT broker at `test.mosquitto.org`.

- `bash python3 ralmqtt.py -m bruteforce -a 192.168.246.147 -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

This command runs ralmqtt in **bruteforce mode** against the MQTT broker at `192.168.246.147`, using the specified wordlist `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`.

- `python3 ralmqtt.py -m discovery -a 192.168.246.147 -u root -p 12345`

This command runs ralmqtt in **discovery mode** against the MQTT broker at `192.168.246.147`, providing the username/password (`root`/ `12345`).

- `python3 ralmqtt.py -m dos -a 192.168.246.147`

This command runs ralmqtt in **DoS mode** to perform a Slow Denial of Service attack against the MQTT broker at `192.168.246.147`.

Soon to be added : 
Connect packet sniffing mode, clientId bruteforce support
